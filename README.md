# My_Projects
This repository contains two of my recent projects as a data science student, both from the end of my second semester. They demonstrate data analysis, algorithmic optimization, and performance-driven decision making.

1. **Football Analysis** - shows how senior team minutes influence young players' market value, a key performance indicator in football. (This research was conducted in Hungarian; however everything has been translated to English for this repo).

2. **Knapsack Project** - explores two algorithmic solutions to the classic knapsack optimization problem.
